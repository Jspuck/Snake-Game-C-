Title: Snake Game

Description:
Embark on a nostalgic journey with this classic Snake Game, a timeless arcade favorite, now reimagined for modern systems. This game is developed in C++ and runs in a console environment, offering a blend of simplicity and challenging gameplay.

Features:

Classic Gameplay: Navigate the snake through the screen, growing in length with each food item consumed. The game increases in difficulty as the snake becomes longer, making it more challenging to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

Adjustable Difficulty Levels: Players can choose from three difficulty settings - Easy, Medium, and Hard. These settings adjust the speed of the snake, making the game accessible for beginners and challenging for seasoned players.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing it with each piece of food the snake eats. The score is prominently displayed on the screen, providing a continuous update on the player's progress.

Dynamic Food Generation: Food items are randomly generated on the game screen, ensuring a unique experience in each session. The randomness adds an element of unpredictability, enhancing the game's replay value.

Console-Based Graphics: The game utilizes simple console-based graphics, offering a clean and distraction-free interface. The snake and food items are represented by distinct characters, ensuring clear visibility and a focus on gameplay.

Environment:
The game is designed for Windows environments and requires a console window for execution. It uses standard C++ libraries along with conio.h and windows.h for handling input and screen rendering.

How to Play:
Players use the keyboard (WASD keys) to control the direction of the snake. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's body. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.

Installation and Running:
The game is compiled into an executable file SnakeGameExecutable.exe, which can be run directly from the command prompt in the appropriate directory.
